# Solve a Survey

Resolving the survey consists of withdrawing the remaining budget and gas reserve, leaving the survey unusable.  
To do this, go to the details of your survey using the link `http://survey.inctoken.org/surveys/<ID>` and use the `Solve survey` button to finish the survey.

:::danger Please note
To solve the survey, you must use the owner address, otherwise the `Solve survey` button will not appear.
