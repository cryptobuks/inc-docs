# Introduction

Incentive (INC) is an **utility and governance token** that was born to support a set of projects that allow the use of incentives to promote collaboration and cooperation, some completed and others in process. INC is built on **Polygon**, which addresses Ethereum's limitations, such as transaction speed, throughput, and gas fees.

:::tip Notice
[Initial offer of the INC Token](https://survey.inctoken.org/token-sale) begins January 1, 2023 and ends March 31, 2023.

# INC Survey

INC Survey is a survey protocol based on INC and as such, allows on the one hand that the company develops a questionnaire with the appropriate questions to collect opinions and promote the brand and on the other, that users participate and receive an incentive in exchange for their collaboration.  
As far as we know, it is **the first and only survey protocol on blockchain** where an ecosystem based on trust is forged, which benefits both brands and consumers.
