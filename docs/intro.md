# Introduction

Incentive (INC) is an **ERC-20 utility and governance token** that was born to support a set of projects that allow the use of incentives to promote collaboration and cooperation, some completed and others in process. INC is built on **Polygon**, which addresses Ethereum's limitations, such as transaction speed, throughput, and gas fees.
