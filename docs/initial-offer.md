# INC Token Initial offer

[Phase 1 of the initial offer](https://survey.inctoken.org/token-sale) has a duration of **3 months**, beginning on **January 1, 2023** and ending on **March 31, 2023**.  
The initial rate is 500 (TKNbits per 1 wei) and the final rate is 50 (TKNbits per 1 wei). That is:
* At the beginning of the period 1 MATIC equals 500 INC.
* At the end of the period 1 MATIC equals 50 INC.

All MATIC from this offer is stored directly in the Governance contract ([TimelockController](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.7.3/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol)).

## During the initial offering
- Tokens are assigned immediately.
- The obtained tokens can be used to create surveys and participate in governance.
- The tokens cannot be exchanged for others as INC is not listed on any exchange yet.
- The rate (TKNbits per 1 wei) decreases continuously until the established minimum.

:::info
Once the initial offering with all its phases (maximum 3) is finished, proposals will be created to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.
Next, we will start the listing process on centralized exchanges like Binance & Coinbase.
