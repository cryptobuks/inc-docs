# Solve Survey

Resolving the survey consists of withdrawing the remaining budget and gas reserve, leaving the survey unusable.  
To do this, go to the details of your survey using the link `http://survey.inctoken.org/surveys/<address>` and use the `Solve survey` button to finish the survey.

:::danger Please note
To solve the survey, you must use the owner address, otherwise the `Solve survey` button will not appear.
